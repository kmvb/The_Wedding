			<h3>OUR STORY</h3>
			<h4>Kim + PJ</h4>
			<p>On a summer evening in 2011, a small-town girl living in Toronto met a handsome gentleman who offered to drive her to a softball game as a "favour" to a mutual friend. Little did they know that a seemingly innocent car-pooling adventure was the start of something big!  PJ was instantly taken by Kim's stunningly good looks and impossibly witty personality. Kim was equally smitten with PJ's charming and approachable demeanour. After many more encounters that summer, they fell in love. Over the next four years their love has grown. It's grown on holidays across the US, Asia and Europe; during hundreds of marathon training runs (7 marathons between the two of them!), countless hours on FaceTime (Kim's away a lot!), and a handful of significant moments at Pearson Airport, including a marriage proposal. Together with their family and friends, Kim and PJ are excited to begin their next adventure together as Husband and Wife on December 31st, 2015.</p>

		<h4>Kate Smart</h4>
		<p>Kim and PJ are honoured to have their very dear friend, Kate Smart, travel from Sydney, Australia to not only share in their special day, but to make it official! Kim was lucky to meet Kate when their professional lives crossed paths in 2010. Since then, they've continued to develop their cross-continent bond and make new memories, including a major "bucket list" item - the New York City Marathon - which they ran together in November 2014. Kate was among the first to hear about Kim and PJ's budding romance and PJ was happy to gain her vote of approval instantly!</p>

				<h4>Kate Randall<br>MATRON OF HONOUR</h4>
				<p>As kids, there wasn't much of a relationship to speak of between Kate and Kim. Today, there isn't anything that could keep them apart. Kate is unwavering in her support, love and loyalty to Kim. They say friends are the family that you choose, but Kim knows she's lucky to call Kate both her family and best friend.</p>

				<h4>Casey Wopat</h4>
				<p>The two met in Colorado as colleagues and quickly became friends who shared a love of Mexican food and marathon shopping sprees. Despite living in different countries, Casey and Kim have enjoyed many adventures together, including a recent trip along the California Coast in a convertible singing at a volume that is only acceptable among the closest of friends.</p>

				<h4>Jenn Shadbolt</h4>
				<p>As any romantic comedy will tell you, the best relationships develop in the most unusual places! Such was the case for Kim and Jenn when they were bumped off of an oversold flight at the Chicago Airport in the Windy City years ago. The two did what any strangers would do: they explored the city together and became lifelong friends.</p>

				<h4>Kendyl Dobbin</h4>
				<p>As Kim's unofficial (and underpaid) life coach, Kendyl strikes a unique balance of ambition, fun, sincerity, generosity and spontaneity. Kim hopes to forever keep Kendyl at arm's length in anticipation of her international bestselling "Book on Life", which is sure to earn millions.</p>

				<h4>Carla Trone</h4>
				<p>As gingers on planes, trains and automobiles, Carla and Kim have travelled more than 10 countries and even more U.S. states together while laughing at Chuck Kloosterman novels and star gazing among European castles. Carla is the kind of girl who would give you the shirt off her back, and Kim borrows her clothing frequently to prove it.</p>

				<h4>Matthew Schulz <br> BEST MAN</h4>
				<p>P.J. and Matt's friendship was established 27 years ago. P.J. and Matt met in pre-school and legend has it that mutual awesomeness brought them together. In reality, it may have been a pre-arranged seating assignment, but either way, they've been best friends ever since. Why he’s standing up there: Best… Friends.</p>

			<div class="content">
				<div class="picture img2"><img src="images/chuck.jpg"></div>
				<h4>Chuck DeGuzman</h4>
				<p>P.J. and Chuck were college roommates - how cliché! The residence staff was right on the money with this pairing - they share a mutual love of Dungeons and Dragons, gambling and football. Why he’s standing up there: He knows every line to “Not Another Teen Movie”.</p>

		<div class="groomsmen">
			<div class="content">

				<h4>Brett Guarino</h4>
				<p>“He is like you in almost every way and you could say Brett is your replacement” – direct quote from Matt Schulz when Matt and P.J. temporarily went to separate high schools. Instead of fighting his doppelgänger, P.J. befriended him. Matt was right, Brett and P.J. were the same person and twice as funny together. Why he’s standing up there: They are basically the same person.</p>
